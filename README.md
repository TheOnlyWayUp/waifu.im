# WAIFU.IM
### A really useful and easy to use API that allows you to get waifu pictures between more than 14 tags and 4000 images !

The API has originally been created to be an alternative to [waifu.pics](https://github.com/Waifu-pics/waifu-api) because the API didnt match some of my requirement (lack of nsfw endpoint for example), therefore i decided to create this API.

The API is documented [here](https://waifu.im/docs/), it can allows you to retrieve random anime pictures sorted by tags and has a unique feature (at the day i write this), that is called Gallerys, indeed you can add your favorite pictures to a gallery (by using the site, the discord bot or even the API itself).
You can retrieve a json containing your gallery's informations (images sorted by tags) and you can also add new pictures (see the documentation).

Finally i would like to thanks [JSH32](https://github.com/JSH32) for firstly creating waifu.pics wich gave me later the idea to create my one, and secondly for giving me precious advices when he didtn't even know me.
