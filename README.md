# WAIFU.IM
An easy to use API that allows you to get waifu pictures between more than 14 tags and 4000 images !



WAIFU.IM has originally been created to be an alternative to [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics), because it didn't match some of my requirements. Bit by bit waifu.im has been improved to an extent that makes me proud to say that it is probably one of the best waifu API. You can now compose a gallery of your favorite pictures, and even upload new ones. Note that any relevant upload is gladly welcomed. It is easy to use and well-thought-out so that most of the endpoints have the same json structure. Finally, I would like to thank [JSH32](https://github.com/JSH32) for his precious advice regarding the infrastructure when he did not even know me.
