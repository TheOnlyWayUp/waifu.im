# WAIFU.IM
An easy to use API that allows you to get waifu pictures between more than 14 tags and 4000 images !

The API has originally been created to be an alternative to [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics), because it didn't match some of my requirements. Bit by bit it has been improved to an extend that makes me proud to say that it is probably one of the best waifu API. You can now compose a gallery of your favorite pictures, and even upload new ones. Note that any relevant upload is gladly welcomed. The API is really easy to use and was well-thought-out so that any developer would have minimal things to change for every different endpoint. Finally, I would like to thank [JSH32](https://github.com/JSH32) for his precious advice regarding the infrastructure when he did not even know me.
